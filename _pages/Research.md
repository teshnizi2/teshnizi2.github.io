## Scientific and Technical Experience

- **Sharif University of Technology** | [RIML Laboratory](https://rohban-lab.github.io/)  
  *Aug 2023 – Present*  
  *Research Assistant \| Supervisor: [Dr. Mohammad Hossein Rohban](https://sharif.ir/~rohban/)*  
  - **Research**: Developed a model to detect counterfeit Iranian black tea from images, achieving 95% accuracy. Co-authored a research [paper](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GuZoTw4AAAAJ&hl=en) published in MDPI *Horticulturae* (2024). Currently leading a team using 3D CNNs to analyze MRI scans of beans for quality assessment.  
  - **Teaching**: Created 50 hours of video tutorials and 400 pages of lecture notes on ML topics.  
  - **IT**: Maintained the lab's website and GitHub. Implemented a VPN with 17 servers during the 2023 Iran internet shutdown to provide lab members with internet access.

- **Sharif University of Technology** | [RADIAN Laboratory](https://sina.sharif.edu/~bardiasafaei/RADIAN-Lab.html)  
  *Sep 2023 – Present*  
  *Research Assistant \| Supervisor: [Dr. Baria Safaei](https://sharif.ir/~bardiasafaei/Home.html)*  
  - **Research**: Developed a new synthetic data generation pipeline using GANs, VAEs, and Gaussian mixture models to estimate crowd sizes in unseen environments using WiFi signals. Used the synthetic data to improve out-of-distribution performance by 200%.
