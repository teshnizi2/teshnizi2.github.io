## My Focus Areas

### Precision Agriculture  
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
  <div style="flex: 1; padding-right: 1rem; text-align: justify;">
    Iâ€™m passionate about leveraging <strong>sensors</strong>, <strong>machine learning</strong>, and <strong>IoT</strong> to revolutionize farming practices. My projects range from automating crop monitoring to optimizing resource useâ€”all aimed at boosting sustainability. Recently, Iâ€™ve begun exploring how <strong>robotics</strong> and <strong>reinforcement learning</strong> can create autonomous systems that dynamically respond to changing conditions, enhancing efficiency and intelligence in the field.
