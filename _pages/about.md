# Hello!

Iâ€™m a recent graduate in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, where Iâ€™ve been exploring how advanced technologies can address real-world challenges. My work focuses on blending **human-computer interaction**, **machine learning**, and **IoT** to create innovative solutions that are both impactful and practical.

## What does that mean exactly?

### Precision Agriculture  
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
  <div style="flex: 1; padding-right: 1rem;">
    I am passionate about developing tools that integrate **sensors**, **machine learning models**, and **IoT systems** to revolutionize farming practices. My projects have included automating crop monitoring, optimizing resource use, and improving sustainability in agriculture. Iâ€™ve also been exploring how **robotics** and **reinforcement learning** can enable autonomous systems that adapt to environmental conditions, bringing a new level of efficiency and intelligence to agriculture.

  <div style="flex: 1;">
    My other focus lies in designing **wearables** and **human-computer interaction (HCI)** systems that transform the way people interact with technology. By incorporating **image processing**, **sensors**, and **reinforcement learning**, I work to create adaptive systems that provide personalized, intuitive, and data-driven experiences. From health monitoring wearables to smart devices that seamlessly integrate into daily life, my goal is to make technology more accessible and human-centered.
