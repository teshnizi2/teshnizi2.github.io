# Hello!

Iâ€™m an undergraduate in Computer Engineering at Sharif University of Technology, where I'm constantly exploring how to bring advanced technology from the lab into everyday life. My work centers on two main areas: creating intelligent systems for sustainable agriculture and developing user-friendly wearable and human-computer interaction (HCI) tools.

## What does that mean exactly?

### Sustainable Agriculture  
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
  <div style="flex: 1; padding-right: 1rem;">
    I design solutions that use sensors, machine learning, and IoT technologies to optimize resource use and monitor crop health. Imagine tools that provide farmers with real-time insights for smarter decisions about irrigation, fertilization, or pest control. This is where data meets real-world challenges in agriculture, helping to create more sustainable and efficient practices.

### Wearable Technology & HCI

  <div style="flex: 1;">
    On the wearable and HCI side, I focus on building devices and interfaces that are intuitive and innovative. By translating complex data into actionable insights, I create tools that help people monitor their health or interact with technology seamlessly. Whether itâ€™s a smart wearable or an intuitive app, my goal is to make technology more accessible and impactful in daily life.
