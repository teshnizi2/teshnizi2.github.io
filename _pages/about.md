# Hello!

Iâ€™m a recent graduate in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, where Iâ€™ve been focused on turning advanced technologies into practical tools for real-world impact. My work brings together **human-computer interaction**, **machine learning**, and **IoT** to tackle challenges in agriculture, health, and beyond.

## My Focus Areas

### Precision Agriculture

  <div style="flex: 1; padding-right: 1rem;">
    Iâ€™m passionate about integrating <strong>sensors</strong>, <strong>machine learning</strong>, and <strong>IoT</strong> to transform farming practices. My projects range from automating crop monitoring to optimizing resource use, all with the goal of making agriculture more sustainable. Recently, Iâ€™ve been exploring how <strong>robotics</strong> and <strong>reinforcement learning</strong> can create autonomous systems that respond to changing conditions in real time, bringing new levels of efficiency and intelligence to the field.

  <div style="flex: 1;">
    Beyond agriculture, I design <strong>wearables</strong> and <strong>human-computer interaction (HCI)</strong> solutions that make technology more intuitive. By combining <strong>image processing</strong>, <strong>reinforcement learning</strong>, and adaptive sensor feedback, I aim to create user-friendly devices and interfaces that seamlessly fit into daily life. From health-monitoring wearables to interactive smart devices, my goal is to put cutting-edge tech in the hands of everyday users.

## Bridging Research & Real-World Impact
My mission is to connect breakthroughs in <strong>machine learning</strong>, <strong>robotics</strong>, and <strong>IoT</strong> with applications that truly improve lives. Whether itâ€™s more efficient farming or more accessible consumer tech, I believe innovation should be both visionary and practicalâ€”helping industries, communities, and individuals thrive.
