# Hello!

I’m a recent graduate in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, where I’ve been focused on turning advanced technologies into practical tools for real-world impact. My work brings together **human-computer interaction**, **machine learning**, and **IoT** to tackle challenges in agriculture, health, and beyond.

## My Focus Areas

### Precision Agriculture  
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
  <div style="flex: 1; padding-right: 1rem;">
    I’m passionate about integrating **sensors**, **machine learning**, and **IoT** to transform farming practices. My projects range from automating crop monitoring to optimizing resource use, all with the goal of making agriculture more sustainable. Recently, I’ve been exploring how **robotics** and **reinforcement learning** can create autonomous systems that respond to changing conditions in real time, bringing new levels of efficiency and intelligence to the field.

  <div style="flex: 1;">
    Beyond agriculture, I design **wearables** and **human-computer interaction (HCI)** solutions that make technology more intuitive. By combining **image processing**, **reinforcement learning**, and adaptive sensor feedback, I aim to create user-friendly devices and interfaces that seamlessly fit into daily life. From health-monitoring wearables to interactive smart devices, my goal is to put cutting-edge tech in the hands of everyday users.

## Bridging Research & Real-World Impact
My mission is to connect breakthroughs in **machine learning**, **robotics**, and **IoT** with applications that truly improve lives. Whether it’s more efficient farming or more accessible consumer tech, I believe innovation should be both visionary and practical—helping industries, communities, and individuals thrive.
