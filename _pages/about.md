Hello!

    I am a BSE student majoring in Computer Engineering at Sharif University of Technology, currently being supervised by Professor [Rohban](http://sharif.ir/~rohban/) and Professor [Bardia Safaei](https://sharif.edu/~bardiasafaei/).

<h2>My Research Interests</h2>
 
   I am deeply engaged in research focused on AI and machine learning, with a particular emphasis on healthcare and environmental monitoring. My work includes developing deep learning models for non-invasive diagnostic techniques and applying AI in agricultural technology for pest detection. Additionally, I am involved in a pioneering project using machine learning algorithms and IoT technologies for identifying individuals in a room through Wi-Fi signals.

<h3> That was a bunch of fancy terms. What does it mean exactly? </h3>

    The terms in my research description are related to the field of advanced technology, specifically artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. These are methods by which computers can be trained to perform tasks that usually require human intelligence, like recognizing patterns or making decisions. My focus is on applying these technologies to two key areas: healthcare and environmental monitoring.

In healthcare, this involves creating systems that can help diagnose illnesses or monitor patient health in a non-invasive way, meaning without the need for surgery or other intrusive methods. In terms of environmental monitoring, it's about using AI to better understand and protect our natural surroundings, for example, by detecting harmful pests in agriculture.

I'm also working on innovative projects like using Wi-Fi signals and machine learning to identify people in a room, which has potential applications in areas like security or smart home technology. This work is a blend of cutting-edge research and practical application, aiming to solve real-world problems using the latest tech.

    Neural networks are good at extracting complicated patterns from high-dimensional data. Instead of trying to solve these intricate graph problems explicitly, we can use GNNs to embed graphical information into numerical representations, feed those to an RL model, and tune the model to generate a solution by maximizing/minimizing an objective of interest.

<h3>It sounds cool! But is it actually useful?</h3>

    This approach is scalable and can result in close-to-optimal results. It, however, is not fully interpretable and lacks optimality guarantees. These characteristics make it a perfect fit for a subgroup of graph optimization problems, but not for all of them. Proper modeling of the input information, expressive architecture design, and problem-specific constraint enforcement are some of the challenges. Making all of the modules work together can also be tricky.

    Here is a list of some domains where this approach can be useful:
* Supply Chain Management
* Grid Optimization
* Social Media Marketing
* Circuit Design
* Network Optimization 
    

<h3>I want to maximize/minimize something on a graph. Can we talk?</h3>

    Of course! Feel free to shoot me an email at [teshnizi@stanford.edu](mailto:teshnizi@stanford.edu). I'd also love to chat about anything else that you find related and interesting!
