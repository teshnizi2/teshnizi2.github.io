# Hello!

Iâ€™m a recent graduate in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, where Iâ€™ve been focused on transforming advanced technologies into practical tools for real-world impact. My work blends **human-computer interaction (HCI)**, **machine learning**, and **IoT** to tackle challenges in agriculture, health, and beyond.

## My Focus Areas

### Precision Agriculture  
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
  <div style="flex: 1; padding-right: 1rem; text-align: justify;">
    Iâ€™m passionate about integrating **sensors**, **machine learning**, and **IoT** to revolutionize farming practices. My projects include automating crop monitoring, optimizing resource use, and enhancing agricultural sustainability. Recently, Iâ€™ve been exploring how **robotics** and **reinforcement learning** can enable autonomous systems that adapt in real time to environmental changes, bringing unprecedented efficiency and intelligence to the field.

  <div style="flex: 1; text-align: justify;">
    Beyond agriculture, I design **wearables** and **HCI** solutions that make technology more intuitive and accessible. By combining **image processing**, **reinforcement learning**, and adaptive sensor feedback, I aim to create intelligent devices and interfaces that seamlessly integrate into daily life. From health-monitoring wearables to interactive smart devices, my goal is to deliver cutting-edge technology that enhances user experiences and empowers individuals.
