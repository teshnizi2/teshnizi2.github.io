# Hello!

I’m an undergraduate in Computer Engineering at Sharif University of Technology, where I'm constantly exploring how to bring advanced technology from the lab into everyday life. My work centers on two main areas: creating intelligent systems for sustainable agriculture and developing user-friendly wearable and human-computer interaction (HCI) tools.

## What does that mean exactly?

  <div style="flex: 1; padding-right: 1rem;">
    For sustainable agriculture, I design solutions that use sensors, machine learning, and IoT technologies to help optimize resource use and monitor crop health. Imagine tools that give farmers real-time insights so they can make smarter decisions about irrigation, fertilization, or pest control—this is where data meets real-world challenges in food production.

  <div style="flex: 1;">
    On the wearable and HCI side, I focus on building interfaces and devices that are as intuitive as they are innovative. By turning complex data into clear, actionable information, I create tools that help people monitor their health or interact with technology more naturally. Whether it’s a smart wearable or an app that makes technology more accessible, my goal is to enhance how we connect with our devices in our daily lives.
