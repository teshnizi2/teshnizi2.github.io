Hello!

    I am a BSE student majoring in Computer Engineering at Sharif University of Technology, currently being supervised by Professor [Rohban](http://sharif.ir/~rohban/) and Professor [Bardia Safaei](https://sharif.edu/~bardiasafaei/).

<h2>My Research Interests</h2>
 
   I am deeply engaged in research focused on AI and machine learning, with a particular emphasis on healthcare and environmental monitoring. My work includes developing deep learning models for non-invasive diagnostic techniques and applying AI in agricultural technology for pest detection. Additionally, I am involved in a pioneering project using machine learning algorithms and IoT technologies for identifying individuals in a room through Wi-Fi signals.

<h3> That was a bunch of fancy terms. What does it mean exactly? </h3>

    The terms in my research description are related to the field of advanced technology, specifically artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. These are methods by which computers can be trained to perform tasks that usually require human intelligence, like recognizing patterns or making decisions. My focus is on applying these technologies to two key areas: healthcare and environmental monitoring.

In healthcare, this involves creating systems that can help diagnose illnesses or monitor patient health in a non-invasive way, meaning without the need for surgery or other intrusive methods. In terms of environmental monitoring, it's about using AI to better understand and protect our natural surroundings, for example, by detecting harmful pests in agriculture.

I'm also working on innovative projects like using Wi-Fi signals and machine learning to identify people in a room, which has potential applications in areas like security or smart home technology. This work is a blend of cutting-edge research and practical application, aiming to solve real-world problems using the latest tech.

<h3>It sounds cool! But is it actually useful?</h3>

    Artificial Intelligence and machine learning are transforming our world in subtle but profound ways. They bring about significant improvements in various sectors by automating complex tasks, enhancing efficiency, and providing deeper insights. In healthcare, AI contributes to more accurate and quicker diagnoses, making medical care more effective and accessible. In agriculture, it aids in optimizing farming practices, leading to better crop management and sustainability. Moreover, AI plays a crucial role in environmental conservation and smart living, helping manage resources more effectively and improving our daily lives through smart technology. Overall, these advancements are not just about technological innovation; they are about creating solutions that have a tangible impact on our world and daily experiences.

    Here is a list of some domains where this approach can be useful:
* Healthcare Enhancements
* Agricultural Innovation
* Environmental Monitoring
* Smart Living
